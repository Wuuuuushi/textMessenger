# YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ OR UNDERSTAND THE JSON SERIALIZATION ASPECTS OF THIS CODE 
# RIGHT NOW, though can you certainly take a look at it if you are curious since we

    The Profile class exposes the properties required to join an ICS 32 DSU server. You 
    will need to use this class to manage the information provided by each new user 
    created within your program for a2. Pay close attention to the properties and 
    functions in this class as you will need to make use of each of them in your program.

    When creating your program you will need to collect user input for the properties 
    exposed by this class. A Profile class should ensure that a username and password 
    are set, but contains no conventions to do so. You should make sure that your code 
    verifies that required properties are set.
